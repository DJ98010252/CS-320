How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

- I can ensure that I implement well working tailored tests that test specific parts of the core
functionalites along side using JUnit testing.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

- By understanding big picture items and then delving into developing singular core
functionalites that combine together to form a working module. The final module should compile
and meet testing standards that are set.


How do I approach designing software?

- I approach designing software with a careful and watching mind.
I am still growing into learning and adding tools to my toolkit.
